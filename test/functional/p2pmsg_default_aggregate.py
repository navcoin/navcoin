"""Default-on aggregation of plain wallet sends (-aggregatesends), pull flow.

Two connected p2pmsg nodes with fast background pull rounds. Node0's puller
solicits candidates via AGG_ANN; node1's wallet serves one 1:1-encrypted to
node0's reply key (replycandidate). A PLAIN sendtoblsctaddress on node0 must
then merge the pooled candidate by default: the broadcast tx spends the
candidate's input alongside the wallet's own, and the candidate is evicted
from the pool. Node1 runs with -aggregatesends=0 and must NOT consume its
pooled candidates on a plain send.
