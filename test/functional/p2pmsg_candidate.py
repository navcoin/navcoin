"""End-to-end test of the pull-based aggregation candidate flow.

Built-in path: node0's background puller broadcasts AGG_ANN requests; node1
(loaded BLSCT wallet, -servecandidates default on) queues them and its
serving thread answers automatically with fee-0 self-spend candidates
encrypted 1:1 to node0's reply keys. Node0 pools them without any RPC
orchestration and no navio-p2pmsg daemon.

Manual path: with auto-serving off, a queued request is claimed one-shot via
listpendingcandidaterequests and answered via replycandidate.
