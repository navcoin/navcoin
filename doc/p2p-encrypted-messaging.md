# P2P Encrypted Messaging

An **application-agnostic, PoW-gated, encrypted broadcast bus** for Navio.

Nodes relay any well-formed p2pmsg message to their peers **regardless of
whether they understand or can decrypt it**. A message carries an opaque `kind`
byte; the relay layer never inspects it beyond keying handler dispatch on the
receiving node. This means a new application claims a new `kind` and ships a
handler in a wallet or daemon, and it propagates network-wide **with no
node-software upgrade** — existing nodes flood it blindly. Proof-of-work on
*every* message is the universal admission gate that keeps kind-blind relay safe
from amplification.

Two applications ship on the bus today:

1. **Aggregation sessions** — cover traffic for BLSCT transactions. A node
   merges single-input-single-output fee-0 "candidate" half-txs from other
   nodes into its outgoing transaction so the broadcast tx hides which outputs
   originate from whom.
2. **RFQ atomic swaps** — token/NFT swaps. A taker broadcasts a signed,
   PoW-stamped intent; passive makers reply (encrypted) with an unbalanced
   half-tx when a locally configured intent matches or a cached standing order
   matches. The taker picks the best quote, aggregates, and broadcasts.

Kinds `7..255` are reserved for future applications.

Every quote/order is signed under a **fresh, single-use** BLS keypair
(`Transport::SignEphemeral`), so a maker's messages are not linkable to one
another or to the node.

The node's inbox is an **identity / prekey split**:

- An **identity key** — the node's stable p2pmsg address. It signs prekeys and,
  by default, is **ephemeral per run** (nothing at rest). With
  `-p2pmsgpersistidentity` the identity scalar is stored in
  `<datadir>/p2pmsg_identity.dat` so the address survives restarts — an explicit
  opt-in that trades the not-on-disk property for durable reachability.
- A rotating **inbox prekey** — the key peers actually encrypt confidential
  messages to. `getp2pmsginfo` publishes the bundle `{identity_pubkey,
  inbox_pubkey (= prekey), prekey_sig}`; a sender is expected to verify
  `prekey_sig` under `identity_pubkey` before encrypting, so a substituted
  prekey is rejected.

Rotating the prekey bounds two things without disturbing reachability:
confidential replies are linkable to one node only within an epoch, not for the
whole run; and an in-memory prekey extraction decrypts at most the current epoch
plus a bounded grace window (retired prekeys are dropped). Because the prekey is
a contact address, rotation is **manual by default** (`prekey_rotation_secs = 0`)
— trigger a privacy reset with the `rotatep2pmsginbox` RPC — with opt-in periodic
rotation via `-p2pmsginboxrotation=<secs>`.

> **Default posture, stated plainly.** With rotation off by default, a node that
> never rotates uses one static prekey for its whole run, so the session-linkage
> the rotation machinery addresses is **only mitigated when the operator opts
> in** (the `rotatep2pmsginbox` RPC, or a positive `-p2pmsginboxrotation`). The
> default is deliberate — auto-rotating a contact address breaks senders who
> cached it — but it means the mitigation is opt-in, not automatic.
>
> **Consuming half is scaffolding today.** Nothing in the node yet publishes or
> verifies a prekey bundle *over the bus*: `prekey_sig` is produced and exposed
> by `getp2pmsginfo`, but the only in-tree verifier is a unit test, and a prekey
> still reaches a sender out of band (fetched via RPC and verified by the
> sender's own tooling). Automatic default rotation is safe only once the bundle
> is published and verified on the bus, so that stays opt-in until that path
> exists — the identity key and `prekey_sig` are the groundwork for it (and for a
> future direct-message app, see the chat note under Forward secrecy).

This extends the navcoin-core BLS-ECIES posture with the identity/prekey split
and a Dandelion++ stem mapping (below).

The subsystem is enabled by default and can be turned off with `-p2pmsg=0`.

## Threading model

Consensus, net, and validation threads never block on p2p-messaging work.

- **Net thread** (`PeerManagerImpl::ProcessMessage`): for `p2pmsg`/`dp2pmsg`, it
  parses the envelope, verifies PoW (one hash) for stamped kinds, checks the
  replay cache, and copies the bytes into the worker queue. No crypto.
- **`WorkerPool`**: `min(2, hw/4)` threads by default (`-onionworkers=N`). Owns
  all ECIES decryption, BLS verification, and tx combining. Fed by a bounded
  ring of fixed-size POD jobs with no per-enqueue allocation; drops on overflow.
- **`CValidationInterface`** callbacks (`CandidatePool`, `OrderCache`) run on the
  background signal scheduler and only do cheap map bookkeeping (evict entries
  whose inputs were spent).

## Wire protocol

Two net message types carry everything:

| msg | phase |
|-----|-------|
| `p2pmsg`  | fluff |
| `dp2pmsg` | Dandelion stem |

The `dp2pmsg` variant reuses the existing Dandelion stem routing
(`m_send_stem`, `ShuffleStemRoutes`) and fluffs with the same probability as
`DTX`.

Envelope:

```
u8          kind        // opaque application id; relay never inspects it
PoWHeader   pow         // mandatory on every message
EciesPacket enc
```

`kind` is a `PayloadKind` (`PING, PONG, AGG_ANN, CANDIDATE_TX, RFQ_REQ,
RFQ_QUOTE, ORDER_ANN`, plus `7..255` reserved). The wire field is a plain `u8`;
a node that does not recognize a kind still relays the message.

### Relay (app-agnostic flood)

`OnWire` (net thread) parses the envelope, verifies the mandatory PoW +
timestamp, and checks the replay cache. If the message is **new and valid**, the
node:

1. **relays it to every peer except the origin** (kind-blind), so it floods the
   network and carries applications this node may not implement; then
2. enqueues a decrypt job for its own handlers.

The replay cache doubles as the relay loop-breaker: each message is relayed at
most once per node. A new application therefore propagates network-wide with no
software upgrade on relaying nodes.

### ECIES

```
EciesPacket = G1 eph_pubkey (48) || ciphertext || u8[16] tag
```

- Sender draws a fresh ephemeral BLS keypair per message.
- Shared secret = `eph_sk * recipient_pub` (a G1 point), serialized to 48 bytes.
- `CHKDF_HMAC_SHA256_L32` derives the AEAD key from the shared secret.
- `AEADChaCha20Poly1305` encrypts with a zero nonce. The zero nonce is safe
  because the key is unique per message (fresh ephemeral key every time).
- The `kind` byte is passed as AEAD **associated data**, so it is
  authenticated: an attacker cannot flip the cleartext `kind` in flight to route
  the same ciphertext to a different handler (the tag check fails).
- The plaintext is **length-padded** to a small ladder of fixed bucket sizes
  before encryption (framed as `u32 length || payload || zero pad`), so the
  ciphertext length reveals only a coarse bucket, not the exact payload size.
- Decryption failure (wrong recipient, tampered ciphertext/tag, altered kind) is
  silent — the common case for broadcast traffic a node is merely relaying.

### Anti-spam PoW

Navio is proof-of-stake, so chain difficulty is **not** a CPU-cost anchor. The
PoW target is a flat leading-zero-bits threshold:

```
target = (2^256 - 1) >> bits           // default bits = 23 (~100-200 ms median CPU)
h = SHA256(version || timestamp || kind || session_eph || payload_hash || nonce)
accept iff h <= target
        && |now - timestamp| <= 120 s
        && h not in replay cache
```

**Every** message is stamped — PoW is the universal admission gate that makes
kind-blind relay safe (no free amplification), not an app-specific choice. The header
binds the ciphertext via `payload_hash`, so the cheap net-thread PoW check also
vouches for the body before a worker slot is spent decrypting it.

`bits` is runtime-tunable via `-p2pmsgpowbits=N` (DEBUG_ONLY) so regtest and
functional tests run at trivial difficulty. If CPU drift ever makes the flat
target too cheap, a `P2PMSG_POW_TARGET_V2` can be activated at a scheduled
height via the existing version-bits machinery.

The single replay cache is a `CuckooCache<uint256>` keyed by
`SHA256(kind || encrypted-packet-hash)`. The packet hash alone does not cover
the `kind` byte, so keying on it would let an attacker pre-broadcast a
kind-flipped copy that arrives first and suppresses the genuine message as a
"replay"; including `kind` gives each `(kind, ciphertext)` its own slot while
staying nonce-independent (re-grinding the PoW nonce cannot bypass it, so there
is no relay amplification). It is memory-bounded (sized by `replay_cache_bytes`);
eviction is LRU/probabilistic under load rather than a fixed time-based TTL. A
message dropped because the worker ring was full is removed from the cache so a
later re-broadcast is not black-holed.

The net thread separates the two PoW rejection reasons: an under-difficulty
stamp is the sending peer's fault (DoS-scored), but a timestamp outside the
±120 s window is not — an honest message can age past it during multi-hop
propagation, so the relaying peer is not penalized for forwarding it.

## Aggregation

A candidate is a 1-input-1-output BLSCT self-spend with `input.value ==
output.value`, **zero fee**, and **no fee output** (built via
`TxFactory::BuildCandidate` / `BuildTx(emitFeeOutput=false)`: only its balance
and input signatures are produced). It does not verify standalone but
contributes a valid balance/signature to an aggregate.

`CombineHalves` builds the aggregate: union all inputs (rejecting cross-half
double-spends), union all outputs, and set the combined `txSig` to the BLS
aggregate of every half's `txSig`. BLS aggregation is associative, so the result
is a single valid signature over the union; no party shares or recomputes
another's gamma. Because candidates carry no fee output, the combined tx has
**exactly one** fee output (the initiator's), and the combined inputs and
outputs are **shuffled** — so an observer can neither count the parties by
their fee outputs nor segment the tx back into per-party runs by output order.

**Fee.** The initiator pays the whole aggregate fee. BLSCT enforces
`fee >= weight(tx) * BLSCT_DEFAULT_FEE` and rejects more than one non-zero fee
output, so the candidates must be fee-0 and the initiator over-funds its own
half to cover the *combined* weight. `TxFactory::BuildTx` takes an
`additionalFee` argument = `sum(candidate weights) * fee_rate` for this.

`CandidatePool` keeps up to `POOL_TARGET = 20` candidates (hard caps: 512 total,
8 per source peer, 16 combined per aggregate), sharded 16 ways by input-outpoint
hash. It dedupes on input (first-seen wins) and evicts a candidate when its
input is spent in the mempool or a connected block. Candidates have no timeout —
they live until spent.

## RFQ

A maker configures `Intent{token_in, token_out, min_size, max_size, price_min,
expiry}` locally (never gossiped). Matching is **config-only**: it checks the
token pair, the size band, and expiry — it does not consult wallet balance.
This is deliberate: an RFQ prober can only learn the advertised config (which is
the offer itself), not the wallet balance. `price_min` is fixed-point,
sell-units per buy-unit scaled by 1e8.

The taker ranks collected quotes (`PickBest`): default `rank_by=price` ascending
(`sell_cost / fill`), with `rank_by=fill` and `rank_by=lowest_cost` variants and
a `min_fill_ratio` filter for partial fills.

Standing orders are broadcast pre-signed half-txs cached in `OrderCache`
(bounded 32 MiB LRU). Their effective lifetime is `min(declared expiry, 14
days)`, and they are evicted when any input is spent. Any peer holding a
matching order can answer an RFQ on behalf of an offline maker.

## RPCs

Maker / debug surface (hidden or `p2pmsg` category):

- `setswapintent token_in token_out min_size max_size price_min expiry`
- `clearswapintent intent_id`
- `listswapintents`
- `listorders [verbose]` — standing-order cache state; with `verbose=true`
  also lists every live cached order (quote_id, buy/sell token, fill,
  sell_cost, price, declared expiry, maker session pubkey, half-tx hash
  and spent inputs — wire-public `ORDER_ANN` fields — plus two pieces of
  THIS NODE's local bookkeeping: `received` (when this node cached the
  order; the set of receive times maps the node's uptime since its last
  restart) and `effective_expiry` (`min(order_expiry, received + 14d)`,
  which leaks `received` whenever the cap binds). Fine over a private
  RPC connection; strip those two fields before republishing the output
  on a public endpoint; the array is sorted by the wire-public declared
  `order_expiry` (quote_id tie-break), so its order reveals nothing node-local
- `getp2pmsginfo` — inbox pubkey + PING counter
- `sendp2pping inbox_pubkey [stem]` — debug echo

## WebSocket listener

Standalone SDK clients — above all code running in a browser, which has no raw
TCP sockets — can take part in the P2P network (and therefore in the p2pmsg
bus) through an optional **WebSocket listener**:

```
-p2pwsbind=<addr>[:<port>]
```

The option is off by default, can be given several times and takes the same
`addr:port` syntax as `-bind` (`[host]:port` for IPv6). Each address becomes an
additional listening socket, alongside the ordinary `-bind`/`-port` ones.

- **Framing.** A WebSocket connection carries the *normal v1 P2P byte stream*
  (24-byte message headers, checksums, `version`/`verack`, ...). Binary frames
  are merely chunks of that stream and frame boundaries carry no meaning; the
  receiver concatenates payloads, so a client may fragment freely and a single
  P2P message may straddle frames. Text frames are a protocol error and close
  the connection. `ping` is answered with `pong`, `pong` is ignored, `close` is
  answered with `close`. Client frames must be masked (RFC 6455 §5.1); server
  frames never are. No extension is ever negotiated (`permessage-deflate` is
  ignored) and no subprotocol is required.
- **Handshake.** A standard HTTP/1.1 `GET` upgrade with `Upgrade: websocket`,
  `Connection: Upgrade`, `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13` and `Sec-WebSocket-Key`;
  the node answers `101 Switching Protocols` with the RFC 6455
  `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`. A malformed request gets `400 Bad Request` and the
  connection is closed.
- **Same peer, same rules.** A WebSocket peer is an ordinary `inbound` peer:
  it counts against `-maxconnections`, gets `NetPermissionFlags::None` unless
  whitelisted, and is subject to the same DoS scoring, eviction and ban logic.
  It always uses the v1 transport (BIP324 is not attempted). `getpeerinfo`
  reports `"websocket": true` for such peers. Limits: the upgrade request is
  capped at 8 KiB and a single frame payload at 4 MiB.
- **No TLS.** `naviod` speaks plain `ws://` only. For `wss://` (which browsers
  require from `https://` pages) terminate TLS in a reverse proxy such as nginx
  or Caddy and forward the upgraded connection to the `-p2pwsbind` address,
  e.g. with Caddy: `reverse_proxy /p2p 127.0.0.1:8355` under a `https://`
  site block. Bind the listener to loopback or a private interface when it is
  fronted this way.

## Status / what is wired

Built, wired into the node, and tested:

- worker pool, ECIES, PoW, transport, net dispatch, Dandelion send;
- `CombineHalves` (verified end-to-end: real fee-0 candidates + over-funding
  initiator half → aggregate passes full `VerifyTx`);
- `CandidatePool` and `OrderCache` registered as validation interfaces with
  live spent-input eviction;
- `IntentStore` matching and quote ranking;
- the maker/debug RPCs above;
- a cross-wire PING echo functional test.

### Aggregation session loop

The loop is **pull-based**. Candidates are never broadcast in the clear: a
publicly readable candidate is a decoy any bus observer could subtract back
out of the aggregate it later appears in (its inputs/outputs are copied into
the combined transaction verbatim), reducing the anonymity set to zero against
anyone running a p2pmsg node. Instead each node privately fills its own pool:

1. **Pull** — every node runs a background `CandidatePuller` thread
   (`-candidatepullinterval`, default 60s). While its pool is below
   `POOL_TARGET` it generates a FRESH reply keypair per round, registers it as
   a transport session key (bounded TTL), and broadcasts an `AGG_ANN` request
   carrying only the reply pubkey. Pulling runs on a steady cadence decoupled
   from any actual send, so pull traffic never signals that a send is imminent.
2. **Serve** — nodes queue incoming `AGG_ANN` reply keys
   (`CandidateRequestQueue`, deduped, capped globally and per source peer,
   TTL'd, claimed FIFO on enqueue time; the per-peer request cap keys on the
   relaying neighbour, `pfrom.GetId()`, so it is a local flood control, not
   per-requester accounting — ephemeral reply keys and stem routing leave no
   stable origin identity). A `naviod` with a loaded BLSCT wallet answers them
   by default: a serving thread (`-servecandidates`,
   default on, opt out with `-servecandidates=0`;
   `-servecandidateinterval` ticks) claims queued requests and
   answers each with a fee-0 self-spend candidate built from the wallet's
   own coin, sent as a `CANDIDATE_TX` encrypted **1:1 to the requester's
   reply key**. Serving is bounded twice: a per-input reservation (TTL) so
   concurrent candidates spend distinct coins, and a rolling per-window
   budget (`SERVE_MAX_COINS_PER_WINDOW`) so a requester that keeps minting
   fresh reply keys cannot walk the wallet's coin set as reservations
   lapse. `navio-p2pmsg -producecandidates` does the
   same over RPC (`listpendingcandidaterequests` one-shot claim +
   `replycandidate`) for wallet-less orchestration. Only the requester learns
   a candidate; each producer can recognise only its own contribution in a
   later aggregate, so a PASSIVE observer can only undo the cover with every
   producer of that aggregate colluding. An ACTIVE puller is stronger: by
   requesting continuously it can come to hold a share of each serving
   wallet's candidates, later recognise those same coins when they appear as
   cover in an aggregate, and subtract them. The per-peer request cap and
   the rolling serve budget bound how fast that position can be built, and
   operators who do not want the exposure can opt out with
   `-servecandidates=0` — but the collusion argument alone should not be
   read as a guarantee against an active adversary.
3. **Collect** — the `CANDIDATE_TX` handler pools a candidate ONLY when it
   decrypted under one of the node's registered pull session keys
   (`InboundMessage::recipient == SESSION`); candidates readable under the
   inbox or broadcast key are rejected. Spent-input eviction keeps the pool
   fresh. Pool contents are node-private.
4. **Aggregate** — every wallet send RPC (`sendtoblsctaddress`, token/NFT
   sends, staking ops — anything routed through `blsct::SendTransaction`) picks
   a RANDOM subset from the pool by default (`-aggregatesends=1`), over-funds
   its own half's fee to cover the combined weight, combines behind a single
   shuffled fee output, and broadcasts. When the pool is empty or the merge
   fails the send falls back to a plain transaction, so aggregation never
   blocks a payment. `aggregatesend` remains for explicit control
   (`max_candidates`, merged-count reporting).

Wallet building always runs on the RPC/daemon/wallet-scheduler threads under
`cs_wallet`, never on the net or worker threads. The transport is enabled by
default (`-p2pmsg=1`); with a loaded BLSCT wallet both sides of the loop are on
by default — serving (`-servecandidates=0` opts out) and consumption
(`-aggregatesends=0` opts out) — so a stock node both supplies and uses cover
with zero configuration.

### Still deferred

- RFQ taker broadcast-and-collect helper RPCs and multi-TokenId swap combine.

## Security posture

- **Unlinkability**: 1-layer ECIES + **Dandelion++ stem** (per-epoch stem
  mapping, see below) + a rotating inbox prekey under an identity that is
  ephemeral per run by default. Stronger than the plain-Dandelion navcoin-core
  posture, still weaker than onion routing against a global passive adversary; an
  optional Loopix-style mix layer is possible future work. Note
  `-p2pmsgpersistidentity` deliberately makes the *identity* stable across runs
  for reachability — a linkability trade the operator opts into.
- **Forward secrecy**: each message uses a fresh ephemeral sender key
  (ephemeral-static ECDH), so a sender's key never sits at rest. The recipient
  *prekey* is static between rotations, so replies within one prekey epoch are
  not individually forward-secret; prekey rotation (manual via
  `rotatep2pmsginbox`, or periodic via `-p2pmsginboxrotation`) bounds a prekey
  extraction to one epoch (+ grace) rather than the whole run. Full per-message
  forward secrecy would need an ephemeral-ephemeral handshake (the requester
  contributing an ephemeral prekey, X3DH-style); this is a poor fit for a
  serverless flood overlay — one-time prekeys need a directory to distribute and
  a way to prevent reuse — so it is tracked as future work. The **session-key
  path** (RFQ reply keys, aggregation reply keys) already gets per-exchange
  forward secrecy today because those keys are per-request and dropped after use;
  any future direct flow that can do an initial round-trip (e.g. a chat session)
  should ride a session key rather than the static prekey.
- **DoS**: flat-target PoW on every message, a **global** relay token bucket
  (`relay_tokens_per_sec`) capping this node's amplification, DoS scoring for
  malformed/under-PoW messages (but NOT for merely stale timestamps), silent
  drop on MAC failure, and bounded queues/caches that drop rather than grow.
  Per-source caps additionally bound the aggregation candidate pool
  (`POOL_MAX_PER_PEER`). Note the relay limiter is global, not per-peer.
- **Mixed networks**: the `NODE_P2PMSG` service bit advertises a *relay*
  capability -- that the node processes and forwards P2PMSG/DP2PMSG -- and
  `forward()` stems/broadcasts only to peers that set it. It is a routing hint
  only: it does **not** promise the node serves candidates (that is the separate
  `-servecandidates` behaviour). A node that does not run p2pmsg silently drops
  these messages without relaying, so routing to it would lose the message (a
  stem hop dead-ends, a fluff copy is wasted); the bit keeps the overlay on
  capable peers. Advertisements are unauthenticated, so a peer may set the bit
  and not actually relay (the message is then just lost, as it would be with no
  path) -- best-effort, but strictly better than routing blind.
- **Participation is network-visible**: because `NODE_P2PMSG` is a service flag,
  it rides ADDR gossip and appears in `getpeerinfo`/`getnodeaddresses`. Enabling
  `-p2pmsg` therefore announces participation network-wide, not just to direct
  peers -- an observer can enumerate the capable set without connecting to each
  node. This is the standard service-bit trade-off (the same is true of
  `NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS` etc.), but it means p2pmsg is not a covert-participation
  feature: the fact that you relay the overlay is public, even though message
  contents and your role in any given message are not. `getp2pmsginfo` reports
  `relay_capable_peers`, the count of directly-connected peers advertising the
  bit; treat it as a lower bound, since capability propagates via ADDR beyond
  your own connections.
- **Dandelion++ stem routing**: in the stem phase a node forwards to a **single
  successor pinned for the whole epoch** (`stem_epoch_secs`, ~10 min, with a
  per-node random phase offset so rotations are not globally synchronized), not a
  fresh random successor per message. This is the defining Dandelion++
  improvement over plain Dandelion: because every stem message a node relays in
  an epoch exits through the same peer, an adversary observing that node's stem
  traffic cannot use fan-out-to-different-peers to separate messages the node
  *originated* from messages it merely *relayed*, nor learn the stem graph by
  watching successor choices vary. The successor is re-rolled only when the epoch
  rolls over or the pinned peer becomes ineligible (disconnect, or dropped the
  `NODE_P2PMSG` bit). If no eligible successor exists, or the pinned successor is
  the very peer a message arrived from (which would loop), the node **fluffs**
  that message instead of dead-ending it -- privacy is preserved because the
  fluffing node is the one broadcasting. A stem successor still learns its
  immediate predecessor *relayed* the message, not that it *originated* it; a
  colluding fraction of the stem graph degrades this the usual Dandelion++ way,
  and the ECIES layer hides contents throughout. Remaining gap vs. the full
  Dandelion++ paper: no explicit embargo timer to detect a black-holing stem
  successor (a dropped stem message is recovered only when its origin re-sends);
  tracked as future work.
- **RFQ probing**: config-only matching means probing cannot binary-search a
  maker's balance; it can only enumerate advertised config.
- **Candidate-serving probing**: a served candidate is a signed self-spend of
  one real, unspent output — a proof of ownership resolvable on-chain by the
  requester (navio outpoints are output hashes anyone can derive). Serving is
  on by default (opt out with `-servecandidates=0`) and bounded against
  enumeration. The enumeration bound that matters is origin-independent: a
  rolling per-window budget on distinct coins served
  (`SERVE_MAX_COINS_PER_WINDOW`), so repeated pulling saturates instead of
  walking the coin set — this holds regardless of who asks or how the request
  is routed. Ephemeral reply keys and Dandelion stem routing mean there is no
  stable per-requester identity, so the per-peer request cap and FIFO claim
  order (on enqueue time, never on requester-chosen key bytes) are local
  relay-flood/fairness controls on the queue rather than per-origin accounting.
  A per-input reservation TTL keeps concurrent candidates spending distinct
  coins. Amounts stay blinded and a candidate cannot be
  redirected or broadcast standalone.
- **Half-tx replay**: a quote signs `(uuid, half_tx hash, expiry)` under a fresh
  single-use key; the matcher is one-shot per `uuid` and first-write-wins on a
  uuid (a re-broadcast of the same uuid cannot redirect a maker's reply). The
  taker enforces the token pair (`AddQuote` rejects a quote whose pair differs
  from the request) and the quote's expiry at accept time.
- **Crypto**: per-message ephemeral BLS ECDH + ChaCha20Poly1305 + HKDF, with the
  `kind` byte bound as AEAD associated data and length-bucket padding. No
  post-quantum primitives yet; PQ migration is tracked separately.
